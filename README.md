## Healthcare Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization skills using SQL and Power BI, focusing on key healthcare insights such as patient data, hospital performance, and treatment trends.

The project is divided into two independent parts:

SQL Queries — For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis from a healthcare dataset.

Power BI Dashboard — For visualizing trends and metrics using prepared or sample data.

*⚠️ Note: The SQL queries and Power BI dashboard are not directly connected. They are presented separately to showcase both database querying and data visualization skills.*
